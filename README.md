# Event Scheduler
This is the first app that I developed on Flutter. It is a basic event-scheduling app where one can enter the details of an event and that would be added to the event list.

## Features
* The app's home screen has a list of events that are added.
* The bottom right corner of the app has a button, which on press navigates to the page where we can schedule an event.
* The scheduling page has an entry box for entering the context of the event. Choose Date and Choose Time buttons open a calendar and clock respectively.
* An option is also present to mark the event as Work/Personal. It is implemented using drop down menu.
